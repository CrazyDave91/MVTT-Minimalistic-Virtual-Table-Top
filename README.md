## User Guide
### Overview
The tool displays an image on two windows:
- **Preview Window:** Shows the full image and a red selection area. This can be moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse and scaled by scrolling while holding SHIFT
- **Table TV Window:** Displays the selected portion of the image as defined by the red rectangle.

### How to Start the Executable
#### The easy way
Just drag the image you want to display onto the MVTT.exe. It will automatically start with that image on the default display.

#### Running the EXE with Parameters
You can launch the tool from the command line with parameters:
- **First Parameter:** The path to the image file you want to display.
- **Second Parameter (Optional):** The index of the monitor on which to display the second window. If not provided, the tool will use the second monitor if available, or the primary monitor if only one exists.

**Example:**
```bash
MVTT.exe "C:\path\to\your_image.png" 1
```

## How to setup the development environment

The code is written in python and it is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project as follows:

a) Create and activate a Virtual Environment
 1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in your project directory
 2. Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `env\Scripts\activate`. After activation, your prompt should change (e.g., you'll see `(env)` at the beginning).

b) Install the Requirement Packages
With the virtual environment activated, install all necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

c) Run the project as usual, for example:
`python MVTT.py path/to/your_image.png 1`
